The Heroku application's database user roles will be assigned new, random
usernames and passwords and the application's config vars will be updated
imminently with the new credentials. To ensure there is no application
downtime, the old application database credentials will continue to remain
valid for a short time after this operation is completed, after which they
will be disabled.

Any active personal database user roles will also be deactivated by this
operation, which means that anyone that is currently connected to the database
with a personal user role will be immediately disconnected. Rest assured that
any tables, indexes, views or other objects that are are owned by a personal
user role will not be affected (the user roles and the objects they own will
continue to exist). A personal user role that has been deactivated will be
automatically reactivated when the affected user runs one of the
${cliCmdColour('borealis-pg:psql')} or ${cliCmdColour('borealis-pg:tunnel')} commands (or ${cliCmdColour('borealis-pg:run')} with the
${formatCliOptionName('personal-user')} option).

Add-on data integrations are unaffected by this operation. To revoke database
credentials assigned to a data integration, use the
${cliCmdColour('borealis-pg:integrations:revoke')} command.`
